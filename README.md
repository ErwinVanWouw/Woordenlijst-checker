## Installation
Download the latest version under Releases or on the above website.  

## Key Features
- works in any Windows application
- simply press F9 to activate
- runs completely in the background
- uses hardly any system resources
- shows a verification window for 3 seconds if a word is found
- option to open Woordenlijst.org if a word is not listed

## How to Use
Select the word you want to look up (Ctrl+Shift+Left/Right Arrow). Press F9 and look at your screen.  

If the selected word is found in the Woordenlijst.org database, a small pop-up window will confirm that it is spelled according to the official Dutch spelling. The pop-up window automatically closes after three seconds, allowing you to carry on with your work.  

If the word is absent from the official Dutch word list, a pop-up window will notify you. This dialog window lets you either close it or open the Woordenlijst.org website to suggest an alternative spelling for the word. The word will remain on your Windows clipboard.
