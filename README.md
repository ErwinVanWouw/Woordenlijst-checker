# Woordenlijst-checker
A handy tool to quickly look-up words in Woordenlijst.org within your active Windows-app

## Introduction

## Installation
Download the latest version under Releases or on the above website.  

## Key Features
- works in any Windows application
- allows you to modify the default shortcut key F9
- multi-monitor support
- runs completely in the background
- uses hardly any system resources
- shows a verification window for 3 seconds if a word is found
- option to open Woordenlijst.org if a word is not listed

## How to Use
Select the word you want to look up (Ctrl+Shift+Left/Right Arrow). Press F9 and look at your screen.  

If the selected word is found in the Woordenlijst.org database, a small pop-up window will confirm that it is spelled according to the official Dutch spelling. The pop-up window automatically closes after three seconds, allowing you to carry on with your work.  

If the word is absent from the official Dutch word list, a pop-up window will notify you. This dialog window lets you either close it or open the Woordenlijst.org website to suggest an alternative spelling for the word. The word will remain on your Windows clipboard.

## Adjust Shortcut and Popup Location
When you first launch Woordenlijst-checker, a configuration file is created with F9 set as the default shortcut key. If this default shortcut key conflicts with other software on your system, you can modify it. Navigate to the folder where  Woordenlijst-checker is installed, open the config.ini configuration file using Notepad, and replace F9 with your preferred shortcut key (combination).

Would you like the popup window to appear in a different location on your screen or on another monitor? Drag and drop the popup window anywhere on your primary or secondary monitor, and the tool will remember its location. The next time you trigger the tool by pressing F9 the popup window will appear here.
